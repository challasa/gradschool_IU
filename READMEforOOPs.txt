#To run the Program:

      GraphOOPs.py inputfile


#This Program reads in a graph file that has edges represented in two columns.
If the file has more than two columns it raises an error.
A class called Graph and its methods are defined in the following program. Any given instance can have the following methods.

--> getNodes(): gives the nodes in the Graph
--> getEdges():gives the Edges in the Graph
--> getAdjacencyMatrix(): gives the Adjacency Matrix

#Distance Matrix, Clustering Coefficient, Degree Centrality are     calculated based on the Adjacency Matrix.
--> getDistanceMatrix() :gives the Distance matrix
--> getClusteringCoefficient():gives the Clustering Coefficient for the Graph
--> getDegreeCentrality():gives the Centrality of the Graph


The folder in which this ReadMe is found has sample input files. graph1.txt, smallworld.txt
